"If I hadn't read The Golden Fleece Found by Basil Hill first, I might have found Dan Brown's book more interesting. However, having been left hanging and wanting more from the Celestine Prophecies, I needed not just another book of vague riddles, but more meat. The two books are complete opposites. Dan Brown uses myths and allegorical riddles, Basil Hill gives codes from Solomon's Temple, Hebrew Codices and juicy stuff after which the esoteric community have been searching for centuries. When he digs into ancient libraries, he documents debates from which fragments were only available in archaic Latin. Persons have beseeched Rome before for translations, but to no avail.There is a stark difference between a new riddle with no end and an old riddle with a new and plausible explanation. I personally think that we have discovered a new Sagan and perhaps even a new Edgar Cayce. Judging from the reviews of both books, I am not the only one who thinks so.F ""Seinfeld"" Mt.

I would suggest that XP users that are looking for a sim game look to other vendors programs.

The wings, however, are pretty good.  I've eaten wings here with a couple Harps and have had a decent time.

Surprisingly good is their seared ahi tuna.  It is pretty weird to think an Irish pub would do this well, but they do.  A friend ordered it and after shaking my head and saying there's no way it could be good, I tried a bite and I had to eat crow.  

Turf is typically a stop on the pub crawl, so I will definitely be back again for boozing.",neutral

This place is fantastic.  In fact, if CenPho lets this one go under, I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizen's arrest if I ever see you.  However, that is unlikely to happen, because the food is damn tasty.

"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. 

Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. 

Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...

The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.

The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]

The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.

Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. 

The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. 

Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.

In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.

Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.

At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.

We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.",positive

"This is an attractive and feature-packed tablet thanks to the incredibly discounted prices. However, also owning a XOOM, a Galaxy Tab 10.1, and an iPad; the lag and UI inconsistencies in webOS are quite apparent. However, the Android port to the TouchPad is gathering steam, and we may see Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 3.x and 4.x) hitting the TouchPad before the end of the year. As for hardware, the TouchPad isn't too bad. While it is thicker and heavier than any other major tablet, the contoured design helps minimize the unwieldy feel.The glossy and easy-to-scratch plastic finish, however, is a tad disappointing. The dual-core Snapdragon is speedy enough at 1.2 GHz, and most TouchPads are able to handle 1.7 and even 1.9 GHz. However, even at nearly 2 GHz, the OS itself just seems slower than Honeycomb and iOS. Apple's iOS isn't a fair comparison since it can't do true multitasking other than through a few select services. However, since Honeycomb can truly multitask and is much more responsive, there is no reason for webOS to be so laggy. Additionally, there seems to be something funky going on with the touch sensor, as I get loads of missed or mis-registered touch events. They're frustrating because I'm not sure if the device has crashed. For the techies out there, a 1.2 GHz Scorpion (CPU segment of the Snapdragon, based off of ARM's Cortex A8 reference design with a few tweaks such as elements of dynamic execution) is roughly as fast as a 1.0 GHz ARM Cortex A9 (the CPU core in the Apple A5, nVIDIA Tegra 2, Samsung Exynos, etc.) Luckily some patches from PreWare can help fix the lag problem--namely removing the tap-ripple effect. Even still, the software keyboard is almost unusable even with the overclocking and PreWare patches. The auto-correct also leaves A LOT to be desired. I had to disable it in order to have any kind of a decent experience. Issues aside, for fire sale, there is no better tablet bargain. People bought the Nook Color in droves at a significantly higher price point when it was discovered how easily they could be hacked into true Android tablets. Now the TouchPad has a far better screen, far more powerful processor, and has a better form factor at less than half the price. You tell me which is a better value. :p",neutral

Neither of the first two were anything beyond potboiler status, and took liberties with the narrative. I am writing here to correct the negative review on this page from a person in Medford, Oregon. He or she is entitled to his or her opinion, but is not entitled to erroneous information. The 1929 film was nominated for only one Oscar (Art Direction) and won. There was no second nomination involved, let alone a second win.",negative

"In the past I wore headphones and didn't really care much for how it sounded. It wasn't until I purchased this pair that I realized how much I was missing out on when I'd use headphones. This pair is extremely comfortable, even though they are huge. They have a terrible amount of bleed, so if you're planning on wearing them around other people, expect them to hear it too, unless you enjoy listening with the volume down very low.Overall I'm very happy with them, they do not offer an overabundance of bass, but they are audiophile targeted headphones so it is something to expect. I have never heard any distortion out of them and I've been using them for over 6 months. Going back to other headphones is always a shock to me now because the audio quality is so much lower. These will help to increase your appreciation for quality sound.",positive

"I was pleasantly surprised! When this movie was in the theater, I had no desire to see it. Finally, after several of my friends and coworkers kept telling me how enjoyable it was, I watched it on my tablet while on the train to work one day. I have to admit that I laughed out loud and my eyes started tearing up at one point in the film. It won't win any oscars, but I loved the fact that the movie had a great message and pulled it off without any cursing or sex. That's quite an accomplishment these days! And I always love Loretta Divine - she is a riot. Fortunately though, the director did not let her steal the movie. The other characters and actors do a great job too. And it was great to see Angela Bassett starring in a role that seemed to be tailor-made for her personality. Jumping the Broom is definitely worth a watch.",positive

Even when you answer a trivia question correctly though, you don't necessarily advance forward, just another opportunity to roll. In fact, most of the time you might move forward one space just to fall back two spaces. It's very difficult to advance in this game which my group of friends found frustrating. Some of the trivia questions are reasonable but most were too challenging. This game is OK, but I imagine it would only be fun for people who are trivia wizards. Don't waste your time....",negative

Spreading lies and fear couched as ""family values"", the fire and brimstone of the Mt Goshen Church of the Righteous spills over, igniting an all-too-rel conflagration.

Much of the information is old, and many of the sketches are hand drawn in a poor style. That being said, this book is half the price of the Plaster book and is available from Amazon directly. Having compared both at the same time, I would pay the extra money for Plaster's latest sniper book even at twice the price. Either one will serve the purpose, but if you want to see the latest and best techniques and equipment from the current wars ( with old war stories that may get tiring), get Plaster's book.",neutral

"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!

Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are ""seasoned"" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.

My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.

It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.",neutral

The subtlety of the characterizations are brilliant. Like most people speaking about politics, some of the points are valid, others begin to drift into far fetched conspiracy theories.

"I never wanted to read this book my class is reading it. First of all, after reading the first book, I thought that the sequel would be better. To my dissapointment, the conflict was boring. Usually, I like my books to be funny or exciting but this book was the complete opposite. The only parts I did like was tjat there was a character to hate because of the actions they take. Of course I hated Torren. H is a little prick that craves attention. Who wastes other people's food and then blames it on somebody?? I would not know anybody so mad to meet an Emberite and then take them in. I do like how the concept of war is taken and explained in this book to the clueless Emberites. I also find it funny how the Sparks people think of the Emberites as annoying because of their cluelessness. I give this book 3 stars.",neutral

I bought the Champ because I didn't want to have to buy the special bags for the Genie and at first it worked great. Very easy just to flip the top with one hand. Sometimes a wipe would get stuck between the plunger and the outer lid and would need to be pulled out. One day when the Champ was only about 3 or 4 months old I pulled out what I thought was a wipe and it was the liner that had come disconnected. Ever since that liner came out it has not kept the odor in.

"I didn't realize when I made the purchase that the characters in this book promote ethnic stereotypes.

I am German, and my child is Jewish...a very uncomfortable moment for me, even though she is only 2. I brought this book into my classroom to show my high school students after we read a Holocaust memoir, and they immediately made the connection. The German/Jew propaganda of Hitler looks a lot like the images in this book. I don't know anything about the author, and I wouldn't presume to say that this was intentional. Assuming the stereotyping is wholly unintentional, it's sad to see that, even in 1981, ""we"" were so saturated in racial stereotyping that we wouldn't ""see"" this, right off the bat. This book is good for it's social commentary; I will not read it to my child.",negative

They don't talk about when Gina came to sesame street. This is not a reminisant look back at all. It's let's put out yet another elmo dvd, and dumb down the show even more.

The point of the book missed me completely. Perhaps, it is because better stuff has been published since that time. Maybe you had to be there. As an icon to a decade, there was little in the text that was peculiar to that time. Furthermore, the author laid no foundation by portraying convential life in the 40's, leaving no opportunity for the contrast to appear. The writing itself was poetic, rhymic, and at times creative.

Though dealing with the problems of a specific minority, the book can easily be extended for all people in all minority groups. Though not all would have to deal with aspects like racism, they would have also have problems with oppression. Heroism and heroes or lack of them might be one of those problems. The life of the characters is awful and explicitly described by the author. Gaines's mostly simple and concise sentences show everything he wants to show and the rest is left up to the reader. This book is a book that traverses cultural boundaries, and can be applied to anyone and everyone.

I knew there was another ""european"" ending and this DVD has it. I wish I had never seen it. The other ending takes a tolerable bit of entertainment and turns it into crap. I would guess that the makers didn't know how to end it so they did this.What a waste. Unfortunately both endings are here but you have to watch the european version as the American endind is just tacked on afterwards.",neutral

Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.

The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.

I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.

If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.

"AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.

You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.

Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.

They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.

Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)",positive
"The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. 

I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.


So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:

*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.

*Spicy Buffalo ""Wings"": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the ""wings"". This dish is a must try!!

*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.

*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!

Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.


Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving ""meat"" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  

Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.",positive

Holiness doesn't present itself as holy. It just is holy. It doesn't draw attention to itself. This work shows us the shame of trying to live an image of holiness instead of being holy. How to deal with our superficial faith. It's a work about God saying 'no' instead of being a short order cook always supplying us with what we consider to be the best of everything. Obviously, it's sobering. It's also enjoyable and hardly as critical or mean as this review sounds.

"I have played each empire earth version always impressed at the strides made with each successive version...until this one. It looks like EE III was redesigned to better cater to players interested in a first person shooter (FPS) game instead of an RTS. The variations of the different cultures and their technology evolutions were completely thrown out in favor of 3 basic cultures: western, eastern and middle eastern. The more advanced technological stages were diluted and ""cartoonified"" into something resembling a weak PS3 game. The bottom line is that it looks like if you are interested in a rich gaming experience with plenty of variation and some realism thrown in, go this Age of Empires III. It is everything this game isn't.",negative

"John Fahey is a very interesting composer of solo guitar music for the most part. This album is all instrumental, all solo guitar. Quite interesting and harkens back to his early days and his first recording, The Legend of Blind Joe Death, a name he made up for himself. It is less melodic than the 60s recordings, but still very Fahey-esque. I am giving this one three stars only because the first five albums all seem to deserve five stars. Probably the best place to start with Fahey is the Kottke/Lang/Fahey record or any of the first three albums. The later records are more mature and more eclectic. He is just a great musician and one of a kind. See reviews of his other albums for more insight. I just did not find this album as moving as the early works, America (!) or God, Time & Casuality, but still recommended!",neutral

"The sequence of the first seven songs of this album are equal to the pinnacle reached on ""Band On The Run"". McCartney's writing is at a peak with these cuts. ""My Brave Face"" is as catch a single as he has ever produced. ""Rough Ride"" is funk with substance, ""You Want Her Too"" is fun, written with Elvis Costello a'la John Lennon with a very creative ""cartoon music"" fadeout ending. ""Distractions"" is simply one of the finest songs McCartney has written, period. This ballad ranks with his best work ever. Inventive arrangements and incisive lyrics...an absolute stunner of a song. ""We Got Married"" rockss, also with sharp insightful lyrics. ""Put It There"" is a touching acoustic moment. This album trails a bit during the last four tracks, which is unfortunate. But the heights reached up to that point represent the best pop/rock has to offer.",positive

He's my second, so I did manage to train his sister ""on my own,"" but she is a girl and he's a boy, and she's 5 1/2 years older, so it was a looong time ago. I have always dreaded potty training, but this book's ""cheerleading"" style has been so helpful and motivational. We are just at the beginning stages, but this is a great reference. The section on books, potty chairs and other helps is really great. This book is helpful to have on hand when your child is around 18 months so that you will be ready to start the preparation and pick up the cues, even though you will not likely start moving forward until the child is closer to 2 or 2 1/2.",positive

Even on the power saver mode, it will need to be charged twice a day. Second, I didn't start with an external SD card and now I have no memory left. I put in an SD card but can't figure out how to transfer things already on the device to the card. The user's guide is absolutely no help. It tells you to access apps, then settings, then storage. Storage only gives you an overview of how much data is stored. Nowhere to set default or transfer. Also, when typing, the space bar is just above the arrow key that takes you home.

A word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their four-legged friends: allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by YOUR pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day. 

PLEASE CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PETS AT HOME. An unplanned trip to the ER as a result of YOUR inconsideration should be YOUR responsibility. What do you say about that, health care providers???

"Sacks is a different kind of sandwich shop. They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli.

On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)

If you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. 

From their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed. 

Oh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant.",positive

My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.",positive

This fact is discussed in detail by Dr. Carolyn Dean in her excellent book The Miracle of Magnesium. Dr. Dean recommends 600 mg of supplemental magnesium daily. People with asthma who follow Dr. Dean's advice about daily magnesium supplementation often improve dramatically even if they have continued to struggle with asthma under other treatments which omit magnesium supplementation. If you are suffering from asthma please read Dr. Dean's excellent book and follow her advice regarding daily magnesium supplementation. It may well be the most important thing you will ever due to relieve this terrible ailment. By the way, although a variety of magnesium supplements are available, and beneficial, chelated magnesium -- which is readily available in most health food stores -- is the most effective.",neutral

This place is definitely good for what it is, ""it"" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to ""reduce costs"" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.

On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). 

I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).

For those claiming to be ""left to fend for themselves"" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called ""the menu"" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as ""descriptions"" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand?

"Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!

All were destroyed by 9/11 but whose to say such an event won't happen again. Nonetheless it greatly questions the wisdom of buy and hold strategies like his. Some of the companies don't even exist anymore after only 7 years. From my experience there are better systems, and I agree with another reviewer, why would you buy something careening downwards at high volumes?? Just dumb.",negative

His process, developed over more than a decade, of identifying what makes a movie work and what doesn't is, in my view, more enlightening than all the ""how to"" books ever written, including his own.With this book, Goldman's ""Adventures in the Screen Trade"", and to a lesser extent his follow-up ""Which Lie Did I Tell"", I think the budding screenwriter has everything he or she needs to start writing.",positive

His work on this is good, but ""Tribute"" is a much better display of his abilities. Hearing him blast through Sabbath classics like ""Paranoid"" is simply unbelievable. If you want to here Ozzy at his best, listen to classic Sabbath or ""Blizzard Of Ozz"". The only real stand out on this cd is ""Over The Mountain"", and even that can't compare to a lot of Ozzy's other work. This album is good, but it's not great.",neutral

The subject of this book is in large part about the life and times of a woman in an emerging Islamic theocracy (with touches of discourse on the four featured literary areas: Lolita, The Great Gatsby, Henry James, and Austin). It is presented in a disjointed, piecemeal fashion making it quite hard to walk away with an integrated representation of the intended messages. And yet, there are a lot of interesting and even important revelations about what it was like to be a woman in an emerging Islamic theocracy. I would recommend this book to those with sufficient patience and a strong interest in the Iranian theocracy and/or women in the theocracy.",positive

The repetition and near-repetitions of names over the generations invite the reader to conflate information about different characters, demonstrating the interconnectedness of the family members.

Orlando Bloom whines like a 3 year old girl the entire film and proves he has little resonace onscreen when he actually has to speak.

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside.

We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good.

You get to see a first person shooter from an angle not widely explored, literaly behind enemy lines (as the spy). Watch German soldiers doing PT, getting drunk, dressed down, and visiting with local females (french). Although Amazon lists it as an E rating, it is actually rated T, and probalby should be rated M.

"I was greatly disturbed to find out that the Corps series is finished. The main characters at the beginning were exciting and very intersting to watch mature over time. McCoy was the main guy, a true everyman who became a leader in spite of himself. As the series developed, I, as a former Marine, wondered, with all the dalliances going on, how we ever got anything done-much less won the war. This theme runs through all Griffin's series that I have read. It would be better if there was more battlefield and less bedroom action. This last novel has left us all hanging with no end in sight. Come on, wrap this thing up. Let us know what happened to the real heroes, Stecker, Pick, McCoy and the other junior officers and enlisted.

"I used the black kit in my 2012 Tacoma with a Pioneer single din head unit AVH-P6300BT. Issues were that the bracket (made of plastic) had too much flex in it, such that, the overall unit did not seal flush vertically with the stock console. There is a small space about 1/2 way down the console/kit interface. If you press on it it you can get it flush but the bracket has too much play in it to seal the space. If a metal bracket was included this probably wouldn't be an issue. Also a CON, the insert around the head unit is a bit warped and doesn't quite fit flush. There's some sag in the center above head unit.All in all, it's worked out OK for what's available.

The story moved along swiftly at the beginning but then the philosophical issues presented kept repeating themselves and the language continued to be so ""flowery"", that I lost interest in the characters. Maybe because I am not religious and am not overtly spiritual but even for those of you who are, I think the characters become tedious. I feel like the book repeated itself and nothing new was introduced in the second half, nothing dynamic happened and the climax of the story came and went without much notice. I could see potential but I felt like I was just let down. If you are spiritual, you might enjoy this but when I read the last page I felt like Coehlo had gotten lazy on this novel.",negative

"I'm not a die hard Lifehouse fanatic, nor am I Christian (what lead singer/songwriter Jason Wade mostly writes about), but I know good music when I hear it.

The lyrics don't have this hit you over the head obvious theme to them - they can kind of be analyzed however you want. This album is exponentially better than No Name Face both lyrically and musically. Sure, maybe the songs aren't as radio friendly as those on No Name Face, but I think that's a good thing because we get much better quality songs here.

"Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  

My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  

Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.

Welter falls back on a lot of one-trick jokes -- like the Stealth kite, an invisible kite -- that don't advance the plot or reveal anything about the characters. With his wry Washington insider stance, Welter very much wants to be Christopher Buckley -- except he's not half as funny.

Ms. Pryde, though, ought not sing until she works out her vocal problems, of which there are many. The straight tone, often landing south of the pitch, is absolutely frightful. It smacks of serious vocal pathology. I also question the genre-style of attempting chest voice to such high registers wherein the voice cannot sustain it properly. Proper coaching and editing could have elminated the poor pitch issues (the ascending tones of the Schwartz comes to mind), but the vocal problems overshadow it all. Ms. Leon's piano is lovely, and very sensitive, but alas, poorly matched in Ms. Pryde.",negative

"I was never a big Winger fan back in the late 80's/early 90's. I liked most of the singles but never bought anything by them, so I was happy when I saw this cd. Hardcore fans might disagree, but this compilation contains all the Winger most people will ever wanna hear: 14 songs from their 3 albums, an outtake and a newly recorded track. Reb Beach is an awesome guitarist and the rest of the band are all great players too. These guys are/were one of the most talented bands around (even if they sometimes wrote cheesy stuff like ""17"").

"It's a shame that many people will come away from this experience thinking that this is the way legitimate operatic tenors sound. I must say that my reaction was stunned disbelief that this was actually being offered to the public as a serious contender amongst the vast array of truly gifted Verdian interpreters. That roster is long, distinguished and well known (or so I thought), and nothing is to be gained by listing it here, except to say that Mr.Bocelli certainly does not belong in that august company. The painful truth is that this is a tiny, reedy and weepy-sounding instrument. That he can muster a certain amplified heft in his upper register doesn't come close to salvaging this vocal and artistic disaster. The fact that this will probably be a commercial success is depressing, but rest assured that Verdi will survive even this ignominy.",negative

With a 18-55mm lens attached, it is a tight fit with my compact SLR. A full size SLR would never fit with a lens attached.- Outer pockets are too tight and shallow to be useful.- Some clipping or strap points on the side or bottom would be great for carrying a tripod.This isn't a hiking pack, not even a day pack.

The result is a leash that does not retract well, and gets somewhat hung up, having the effect of drooping and dragging rather than being taut at all times. I bought this for my chihuahua, who likes to be way out in front and always kept previous leashes stretched to their max. With this leash, and even though he's well out in front, the leash is just not performing as expected.I think if they had stuck with their original cord width, the leash would work just fine.Very disappointed.",negative

Since then his plots have devolved, his characters never evolve, and continue to be trite stereotypes of american regions (not all Kansans are ranchers, nor all new englanders lobster fisherman) and also misses the most obvious details of military protocol and technology, the public is best served by treating every detail in his books as fanciful fiction (just like all of those of us serving on submarines know it to be) Hopefully his publisher will stop promoting and printing this trite ... and find a new author to spend their efforts on.",negative

I had very low expectations for it and in many ways I was not disappointed; however, it was good escapist fun with a cast of attractive young actors and light-hearted dialogue. Colin Ferrell is definitely a comer with a nice easy (and sexy) screen presence and Scott Caan and the other actors playing the gang members were interesting new faces. In addition, Timothy Dalton was his usual competently menacing self, and Kathy Bates is always good, even though here she has a very minimal part. In sum, a light-weight movie with lots of horses and action and nice-looking young folks to watch.",neutral

It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!

We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.",positive

Although there is some knurling, the coupling sleeve is still quite slippery and you can't get a liquid tight seal unless you tighten it down with a pair of pliers. The second thing is as other have mentioned, if they would supply a pouch to keep the drain line from spewing all over my drawer and getting tangled with other things.Overall, I am happy with it's performance.

The pie crust on page 117 is dry and does not roll out well. The ratio of flour to wet ingredients is wrong. The chicken pie recipe on page 15 is exceptionally bland and the crust is too wet for rolling. The addition of extra flour helps but it's still a hard dough to work with.

"I'm 2 weeks new to Phoenix. I looked up Irish bars in town and found Rosie's. The decor and ambience was outstanding. I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25!

"Into Thin Air is a book about an expedition that went into the ever famous Mount Everest. While on his expedition Jon Krakauer tells about the hardships and his near death experiences. He tells, in great depth, about the people he met on the mountain. Jon also goes into great detail telling how cold and miserable the trip was. He really made me think that I was up there experiencing the same thing he was. At first the book started slow, but in the end the breath taking thrill of who was going to live and who was going to freeze to their untimely death told the story. In this book every minute could be the difference between life and death. I'm glad I read this book, and I would surely encourage it to anybody that likes to be on the edge of their seat while they read. This book really did that for me. Thanks Jon, I had fun reading your book.",positive

Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.

"Exactly as predicted by all the other reviews. I had mine for exactly 1 week, during which I scanned 61 rolls of APS film, all 25 exposure. Roll #62 went with the unit back to Nikon service for repair. It sounded like the gears stripped. I have to believe they built the thing with cheap plastic gears in order to be cost effective, and due to the relatively low volume of sales for such a thing, it's cheaper to repair them then to re-design. Buyer should also be aware that this thing doesn't scan the entire negative area of the APS film strip. It actually cuts off about 3mm of the width of the frame. So if your scanning an especially nice panoramic shot, you might want to get a strip holder and scan it that way, in order to get the entire negative. But when it works, there's no easier way to scan a bunch of old pics.",neutral

"this the second album from dando that i own,the other being,""It's a shame about ray"",is a good pop rock album.i usually despise pop but dando gets away with it for me for some reason.maybe why i like it so much is because of the addition of one of my faves,julianna hatfield singing back-up on most of the album.my only problem with the album really is ""the jello fund"".can somebody explain why it's even on the album? otherwise the album is very good.the lyrics sometimes are a little less to be desired but than dando redeems himself with songs like,""big gay heart"".so if you're a fan of ""it's a shame about ray"" this album shouldn't come as a big disappointment as it's not as great as that one is but is still a good album nevertheless.",positive

"This bar looks really nice. However, the drawer that is nice to hold bar utensils is INSIDE the upper portion that holds liquor. That means that except for the tiny portion behind the drawer (since it isn't as deep as the cabinet), a normal size bottle of liquor cannot be placed in the top area above the drawer and be able to close the lids. So okay, we leave the top lids open all the time and have tips of bottles sticking out the top--not preferred but still okay. We ended up removing the wine storage segments (nice that they remove) and removing the drawer, so we now have a tall open area below for tall bottles, and can keep smaller bottles in the above area. So it is versatile in that the drawer and wine board segments remove. But just not tall enough for regular sized bottles of liquor without having to leave the top open and get the bottles dusty. So it looks nice and it works, but a taller upper section that was actually constructed for the proper height of liquor bottles would have been preferred for us...",neutral

"Unlike the other reviewer, who is clearly a fan of Mr. Dunphy's writing, I found this novel (not memoir) tedious and unreadable. Like most readers, I was hoping for a glimpse into the private life of Capote and his long time companion and what their special bond was. Instead, almost the entire book is about a fictitious Father Synge, who is struggling with his faith and his homosexuality. Even on that level, it fails as good storytelling; Dunphy's faux-literary style is simply third-rate and his ""story"" (don't expect plot) is interminable. A straightforward memoir would have worked so much better, but after reading this, I think Dunphy has neither the writing chops nor the courage to tell a straightforward and honest account of his relationship with Truman. Bottom line: this is NOT a memoir of Jack Dunphy's life with Truman Capote.",negative

"Sony Armstrong is greedy, dishonest, a philanderer, a social climber, and a generally unpleasant person. His wife Gladys, who is better born, is dim, and more than a little superstitous.

The daughter Genetha the subject of the third part of the trilogy takes after her mother, but with everything amplified. All together you would avoid these people if you ever met them. Having said that, the novel does present a picture of British Guiana in the 1920's-1940's with all it's colonial and class related problems, which I found of great interest, and which I believe to be accurate. Having grown up in BG during that period, I was more than a little curious to read how someone else saw life there. I was not disappointed.

"""The Black Rose"" = stinkweed. Its unprepossessing plot is shot full of holes. The poorly drawn characters are generally unsympathetic. Consider the atrocious casting of the film's leading roles: mature, very American Tyrone Power as a young Oxford scholar; juvenile French actress Cecile Aubry--as the (unconvincing) romantic interest--is about as sexually devastating as a kewpie or cabbage-patch doll. The film's leaden pacing, its prolix and unremarkable dialogue, its profound lack of credibility as well as its failure to appeal to any other emotions than this viewer's boredom and contempt result in my judging ""The Black Rose"" as one of the worst films Tyrone Power ever had the ill fortune to make.This otherwise undeserving DVD release does include a single interesting special feature: a Power Family Reunion featurette, in which Tyrone's son, two daughters, and second wife sit down and reminisce about him.",negative

"Sticking with the soul circuit, one album I have kept in my CD player for months has been Miss Alicia Keys' second effort ""The Diary of Alicia Keys."" What a wonderfully done album and a superb example of how to grow from one album to the next. Miss Keys flows as beautifully as her name. All facets of this talent has blossomed tremendously from her debut, which was a masterpiece in its own right. What really gets me with Alicia Keys is her inevitable ability to blend classic piano training with crazy hot hip-hop beats that somehow results in a great sonic balance that appeals to all. Even her dabble with old soul classics are brillantly revived in a way that is respectful of the original, but has crazy modern appeal. Only true talent can exude such excellence in its craft. As track #3 says, ""Go 'head girl"".Recommendation: A must-get if you love R&B soul music. A definite if you want to relive Alicia's brillance from her first album.",positive

"The fourth film of the Heisei series lacks the complexity and seriousness of the previous entries. It is, however, light-hearted fun that is extremely enjoyable.The spfx are excellent, except for Mothra who pales in comparison to Eiji Tsubaraya's classic creation. Battra looks good and is suitably mean and ill-tempered. The Big G is powerfully rendered and played with absolute believability by suitmation actor Ken Satsuma. Koichi Kawakita does excellent work throughout.. though his handling of the film's final battle does not compare well to Tsubaraya's work on the original G. vs Mothra.The plot, though heavy-handed, moves along quickly. The actors, including classic-era actor Akira Takarada, are uniformly engaging. Once again, Akira Ifukube contributes a perfect score.G. and Mothra may not be the best of the new G series but it is still a very good sci-fi film for all ages.",neutral

This record contains one of the greatest ballads I ever heard (""Either End of August"") and it is in 5/4.All in all, this record is amazing.

I'd rather be able to load AA's like I do in my other ""real"" canon grip I have on my old Elan7.That being said, the grip feels great in your hand, adds a lot more grip to hold onto while using the cam., and you can't tell without looking really closely that the grip isn't an original part of the camera...it fits that well.

If you're a fan, you can interpret this inferior production in many ways, whether it is a factor of her age, her odd personal life, her state of mind, whatever.

The book picks up a little steam mid-way, but not enough to make up for the lackluster beginning.

But mid-way into the film what was subtle becomes blatent, what was creepy becomes cheesy, and what was promising does not ever find its full potential. The climax of the film is completely underwhelming, though mid-way through things start to become more amusing than frightening. All in all, it's a bottom-of-the-wrung supernatural thriller, and if you want to see good against evil on a Biblical scale, check out The Devil's Advocate instead.",negative

"I think Aguirre the Wrath of God is impressively insane. It has that feel for being caught (and then lost) in an endless, inescapable landscape. Be it traversing the mountains and cataracts, or on the wide, flat Amazon river drifting interminably between impenetrable jungles - feeling the unseen eyes of hostile natives constantly watching you - the atmosphere of this story started out dangerous and simply crazy, and then things just got steadily worse and worse, until they got as bad as things can get! I loved it. Cinematic art doesn't get much better than this film, imho.",positive
"I had first read Krakauer's Into Thin Air - an astonishing, well-written, and sensational account of the 1996 season on Everest - which started my interest in mountaineering memoirs and in Everest stories, in particular. I purchased The Climb with great anticipation about a separate, ""rebuttal"" point of view, and was not disappointed. Whatever your opinion about what happened in 1996, it is hard not to respect and admire Boukreev after reading this. Sure, the writing is not as polished as Krakauer's book, but I was still turning pages as quickly as possible. Even a completely non-narrative, factual account of the goings-on in 1996 at the roof of the world would be gripping. As a singular book, I think The Climb absolutely can stand on its own. As one in a series on Everest 1996, the story becomes even more compelling.",positive

"Though perhaps not the place you may pick for a special brunch with champagne and chocolate brioche French toast (a signature breakfast at the Sofitel Philadelphia), the Good Egg is my choice for neighborhood breakfast that offers consistent service and food in a comfortable atmosphere.

No matter how busy the restaurant becomes, and on Sunday it is packed,  the staff is always friendly and welcoming. You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant!

The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of ""fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas... 

We always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix.

"""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon"" (1943) is one of the better World War II entries - pitting Basil Rathbone's immortal detective against Lionel Atwill's sinister Professor Moriarty. In his first Holmes effort, director Roy William Neill makes the most of a ""blood-draining"" climax. Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson is far less bumbling than usual, with the comic relief provided by Dennis Hoey's debut as Inspector Lestrade. Fast-moving escapism that gets the job done in 68 minutes.

Vince Lombardi died at the right time, as the football world he knew, without big business and million dollar salaries, was crumbling all around him.

"Beer...or Yoga?

Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.

Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.

Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  

That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.

As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). 

So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.

I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. 

Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending:

The whole thing is slow slow slow, and entirely acted out on this farm, which does not add to the story or entertainment value at all.

They're a lot smaller than I thought they'd be for some reason, it's a little smaller than my ears, but that's not a problem at all.The sound is great, I plugged them in and started playing a favorite song, it sounded so good. The bass is really nice, I could feel it like never before, and unlike other headphones with stronger bass the sound wasn't muffled or muddy sounding.Best headset I ever bought, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for quality on a budget.Edit:It's been 4 months and I've got a serious rattle in my left ear, I'm going to have to spend $19 for shipping both ways.

It takes a very skilled interviewer or fantastic didactic vision on the part of the artist to arrive at a genuinely insightful piece of writing, like ""On Art"" by Rodin [excellent]. Also fairly good are David Sylvester's interviews of Bacon and others.Many of the entries in this book are meant to actually BE THE ART. Such writings can be interesting, but often fail, falling into a category of minimalist authorship. I found this book did not aid my search for profundity and revelation with regard to the artistic process.",negative

"A strange contrast in stories. I liked ""Class Trip"" for Nicholas's wonderful, if not morbid, imagination. I was slighty disappointed in his lack of action but most of the story takes place in his imagination anyway. He reminded me of the character Eugene in Wolfe's ""Look Homeward Angel"" ""The Mustache"" is a Kafka-eske novella, but not as much as the plug on the back of the book sets you up for. It is bizzare none the less especially towards the odd ending where the main character feels trapped in an existenstialist world. The shift is a bit ackward and the whole idea of everyone forgotting you had once had a mustache is a large stretch. I think it would be better if his wife and friends forgot who he was/ didn't recognize him when he shaved off his mustache. His paranoia is similar to Nicolas's but much worse. I recommend reading ""Class Trip"" but save your shaving cream for a different mustache.",negative

Honestly, I loved the book, usually I'm defending film adaptations of wonderful books; this time I can't. It was terrible, I haven't seen an adaptation this awful since Eragon.

"My girlfriend liked this place more than I did. It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. 

The service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of ""everything is good, just order something so I can go home"". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. 

It wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better"", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.",negative

Eventually, after a day on which I prepared four loaves, the motor simply failed.To their credit, Kitchenaid sent me a brand new ""Artisan"" model mixer, and explained that they were not yet replacing the big machines due to some engineering problems (which I'm pretty sure were unrelated to my issues; something about confectioner's sugar gumming up the on-off switch).If you're making cookie dough and primarily using the whisks or the main beater, the Kitchenaid is a great machine. ....",neutral

It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.
As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card ""holidays"".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for ""corking fees"", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.
Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.",positive

Although the traditional Taoist approach is that following set guidelines will likely steer you away from the Way, perhaps for some people, living within guidelines of Confucianism or Puritanism is their Way. Whether it truly is or not, I felt that Hoff could have shown more respect for others' points of view at times. Nevertheless, I think this book is well worth reading, especially for someone new to the ideas of Taoism.

"I'd love to give these guys a better review, because they were very friendly and professional.  However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.

Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.

On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!

When you advertise on your website ""showroom quality,"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.

The Kahlua pork plate at Rumbi has lately been the first meal that comes to mind when I want comfort food. This is a bit of a problem cause that is normally on a work day during lunch and after eating a meal of pork, rice, mac salad, and coleslaw, I am just down right exhausted and in dire need of a nap. 
I used to come here quite frequently but forgot about this place and I am not sure why. Besides the Kahlua pork and Rumbi rice, I can say that their mac salad, sweet potato fries, and their beach burger are really good as well. If you are looking for something different, yet tasty and satisfying, try Rumbi. I think you will enjoy it.",positive

Then he dies.The other extra story is Too Many Tamales. It's about a girl who is helping her mother make tamales. She can't resist the temptation to try on her mother's ring. The ring disappears from her hand while she is mixing the dough. She and her siblings force themselves to eat all the tamales in search of the ring but cannot find it.

These tended to be critical of traditional Islamic beliefs. The truth is, academic understanding of the Christian and Hebrew Bible is also often at odds with traditional beliefs. I don't put much faith in the academics, but do try to understand what they are presenting.

"My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. 

What I had:
Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. 

I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was ""anythings good.""

"After my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, I got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  I thought to myself, ""how nice"", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.

So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a ""different"" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.",positive

Those done by progressivetranscriptions.com are amazingly well done, testament to the dedication and professionality of these guys. There is hardly a mistake to be found.However, all the other tracks are another deal. The guitar transcriptions in them are from the official guitar books for their respective albums, which means their quality is good (John Petrucci reviewed these). The keyboard, bass and drums on the other hand seem to have been done by a person without experience or talent, or even both. They are embarassingly poor, and as a transcriber myself, I found it hard to read through the scores with these glaring mistakes present.

"A few stars, cheerleaders, comedy and romance seems an inevitable combination for success, right? Uh...no. Man of the House miserably fails to appeal to its target audience.The acting by the cheerleaders is lame. There is room for plot development, but only a shallow attempt is made. What more could go wrong?The story is very slow moving. The background plot of the murder seems irrelevant really. Most of us are watching it for the cute cheerleaders. But instead, we are given stupid girls with no personality. Heck, even sterotypes fail us! We want to laugh at the combination of an uptight ranger and adolescent girls, but Man of the House fails to deliver, yet again.Basically, a no go with me.

"This album is excellent, but not quite as good as ""Whatever And Ever Amen."" I say this because ""WAEA"" evokes a wider variety of emotions, often switching between humor and sorrow, and because WAEA is consistently incredible throughout. This eponymous album has high points and, I think, a low point. ""Underground"", ""Uncle Walter"", ""Philosophy"", and ""Alice Childress"" are awesome; ""Julianne"" falls well below average; and the rest of the album is very good. Why none of these songs have ever been played on my local radio stations is beyond me.",positive

"While I enjoy Bill Champlin's voice and musical talent's this CD has left me wondering if this was done in three parts. First, to include his most recognizable songs (""Turn Your Love Around"", ""In The Heat Of The Night"") to some really excellent songs (""Proud Of Our Blindness"", ""Sound Of The Rain"",""Light Up The Candles"" and ""Must Have Been A Fool"") he has included the rest as typical filler material. Also, these songs sound very 80's-ish because instead of using real instruments, alot of samples and programming are used. Mr. Champlin has done this before and leaves this listener wishing for a full band (with horns) like he plays with in Chicago and The Sons Of Champlin. Take the sound out of the 80's and use real instrumentation, and add some more quality songs and this CD might be worth keeping.",neutral

This morning about two or three seconds after I turned it on, wham! the fan inside fractured and blew out the side of the case. Fortunately with the dryer aimed at me, it blew out sideways, so just startled, no harm. It's obvious from this experience, and now reading previous reviews, that there is a pattern of this occurring.

"I think Jeff Bridge does mumble way too much, did he have marbles in his mouth?. I like Jeff Bridges also but he is not John Wayne. The film really was too slow compared to the 1969 version.

Some say that Glen Campbell could not act (I thought he did a good job) but I feel Matt may have over acted and the script and dialog was odd. I liked Glen Campbell over Matt Damon. I know the end is how the book ends (I have not read the book) but for us who remember and love the 1969 John Wayne version you will not like this one as much if at all. It was an odd movie all the way through and I kept thinking it was going to get better and bust out with action...but no. I bought it and will keep it on my shelf but I am pretty sure I will watch the John Wayne version more often. For what it's worth I did like the girl and feel she did a good job.

It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.

Rumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.",positive

"I don't mind this album. It's got some PRETTY good songs, but it doesn't compare to Final Straw in the least.Final Straw just transported me to another musical plateau. I guess you could call it a concept album in a way. It did tell a story about a relationship from start to finish & it was BRILIANT. The whole thing was just a rollercoaster ride of emotions & feelings.Eyes open just sounds to me like the same old stuff you hear from other bands. I find little originality in it. Lightbody even sounds like he's bored while he's singing these songs.Very disappointing. It's beginning to seem to me like they took the commercial route maybe due to management's advice, to gain more exposure than ""Final Straw"" did with the typical results. The new album did gain wider exposure & sales, but it's ORDINARY. C'mon guys, you can do so much better.",negative

"Where to begin?

This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.

Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. 

It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.

"I have read most of Dee Henderson's books, and the Truth Seeker is definitely one of her best! I thought the plot was a bit predictable at times but there was enough suspense to make it impossible to set down.Lisa O'Malley is a forensic scientist who is injured at the start of the book. She isn't able to come back to her job full time for a while so her boss makes her review some murder cases that went cold. Lisa's investigation into some of the murders have ties to a case that U.S. Marshall Quinn Diamond has been following for years. They eventually notice the similarities and exchange information and clues. The rest of the book tells how they fall in love while trying to track down an elusive killer.There are a lot of smaller plots in the book like Lisa's family, and Christianity, but they are added subtley so the book is inhanced by their presence. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to absolutely anyone!",positive

It was probably frost build up because I unplugged the unit for several hours and then plugged it back in and the noise went away.Just recently the unit stopped cooling suddenly, and the internal light no longer works. It's out of the one-year warranty and the manufacturer said that it cannot be repaired. I guess it is junk now and is going to metal recycling.",negative

"eewh! yuck and wtf!?

This Barnes & Noble Book Store sucks for sitting back, relaxing and trying to read. I know it is not a library, and I don't expect it to be. But, come on - you can at least have some sense of trying to keep the noise level down and have some cozy seating. 

And... Yikes! The people here are gross. They had some couch-chairs to lounge in and they were - in all of their grossness. And they were reading magazines of all things. WTF buy it and go home and let your kids do kart wheels there. EEWH!

Then, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every 5 minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either. 

I was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited.

I have been looking for a place to go to read, work and drink some coffee in my area (Arrowhead) and this one is definitely crossed off of my list. 

Come here to try and find a book but don't come expecting to kick back and enjoy your novel or what have you. If you like people watching though, this may be your place. There are all kinds here.

"Where do I begin? I love Casey Moore's!

What a great ambiance! The outside patio is where it's at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.

When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). 

It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!

The oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses.

If you're feeling pretty ballsy, go pee on the Blarney Stone! Every time I go there I wish I was a man so I could do it.",positive

"The cinematography is excellent and, of course, Scarlett Johansson is wonderful to look at. Even Bill Murray is pretty believable as a washed up actor. But that's as much praise as I can muster.

It seemed as though Sophia Coppola just showed the actors her story board and told them to go improvise.

I hope the girl who didn't understand the novel will try a little harder. It is so beautifully crafted. It holds in its pages the heartbreaking longing of youth for love and for their future which is mysteriously yet to unfold.The narrator senses a life beyond his present circumstances through the Transsiberian train's windows. However he sees another future in the harshness of day to day existence there in Siberia. Makine puts a human face on that far unimaginable country. He also teaches us of the loss of war. It is a woven tapestry of character and time in which each piece contributes to the whole.,positive
"really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.",negative

"Grisham's ""The Street Lawyer"" won't keep you turning the pages with excitement like his earlier novels (""The Firm"", ""The Pelican Brief""). There's not a whole lot of suspense, fear, or emotion in this novel -- the main character has an epiphany that leads him to leave his high-paying, power law firm for a street clinic, helping out the homeless with their legal problems -- not the stuff of a thriller. To be sure, there's some contrived tension arising from some shady characters threatening physical violence and the hope that you're still reading The Firm. But the story mostly just unfolds and then gets resolved. At least the main character doesn't end up living in Aruba at the end of this story :-)For true Grisham fans (and I'm one of them), it's a quick and easy read that you might as well add to your collection, but it won't leave you talking about it the next day like many of his other novels...",negative

I like to read. So I went from a BB Playbook to the Sony Tablet. Sony's reader software isn't available for the Blackberry OS. The bigger screen is nice. But that's where it ends. BB Os is simply better and more intuitive. Though both are very simular. Sony Tablet speakers sound cheap. Watching movies on the Playbook gives a better experience than the Sony. The Sonys shell has a cheap plastic feel. Lean it against something and it will slide. A nonslip case would be better. First thing I ended up buying was the Sony cradle. The USB and SD card slot are great. Now if they could only be used in realtime. Right now you have copy files to the tablet before you can use them. Overall if I had the Sony first I would like it better. But the little thinks make me miss the Playbook.,neutral

The book focuses on Harry, a gangster in 60s London, but it does it by portraying him solely through the eyes of others. The book has five sections, each of which is written from within the perspective of each of 5 characters who relate to Harry in markedly different ways. Some characters are handled more effectively than others, but overall it is competently done. The gay sex scenes are described with more enthusiasm than the straight, and the last section in which the relevant character is a professor becomes somewhat didactic, but otherwise it is fairly well-balanced.

"This place is fantastic!

We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm. The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves, take our time, ask if we had any questions. We wandered around for a bit, I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted, and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe. 

Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night. 

This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit, just said ""show me your favorite."" He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.

We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!

Prices are on par with Total Wine, but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job. Great job Sportsman's, see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking!",positive

Also, not sure how much grass it really ""catches"" anyway; much of the clippings still fell into the grass or were tossed overboard when I pushed too fast. Since reel mowers -- push or gasoline powered -- work best when the grass isn't too long, I would argue you could live without this attachment if you mow your grass at least once a week or more.",negative

Giving toddlers candy and soda as treats is no longer acceptable (we don't even do juice unless it's diluted!) and the social structures described barely exist anymore. (Homemaker mothers with nothing better to do, detached fathers, close-knit neighbors and the like.) Further, the idea that children are not to be spanked or yelled at is presented as novel, and the main reward for proper toileting is lots of physcial attention. At least in my household, this is already the norm (as it was in my parents' home). Finally, it addresses pooping as an afterthought, and that didn't work well for us.

"A fan of Jennifer Kries' ""The Method"" series of tapes, I bought this DVD without knowing much more than what was described on the cover. It does not include the abdominal and core strengthening exercises that are the foundation of Pilates. However, there are some traditional Pilates moves on this DVD. It is divided into 3 segments, upper body strenthening, lower body strengthening, and stretching, each about 20 minutes long. The upper body segment is done with light weights and is very similar to part of her ""The Method Precision Sculpting"" video. I found all 3 segments challenging and I feel I will benefit from these exercises. I like having this on DVD so that I can choose which segment to do without having to rewind or fast-forward a tape. Also, the lower body section offers a choice of viewing from 3 different camera angles. The package says there is also an audio option to have music only, but I have not been able to find this on the disc.",positive

"Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that! 

Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).

Nice laid back decor too.

You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order.

I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!

I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!

The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)

I can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!",positive

I used it to chop a ""V"" notch into wood that was 1.5""-2"" in diameter and then finished the wood with a foot stomp.It definitely helped having it. It will be part of my camp bin that I take when car camping. Not sure if I'll carry it backpacking since it's a bit heavy.

This novel-within-a-novel tells the story of a secret affair between an upper-class girl and a lower-class man. The identity of the man is discovered through Iris' story, yet Atwood keeps you guessing which sister is his lover until the very end. I loved this book, and Atwood's insights into society and humanity are poignant and true-to-life. I would recommend to anyone interested in reading a good story.",positive

"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Fists in the Pocket, released in Italy as ""I Pugni in tasca"", is the story of a dysfunctional Italian family and has been both praised and condemned.The story is about a man who makes attempts to murder his blind mother and epileptic brother. The film has been praised for innovation and condemned for mockery of the family which is almost sacred in Italian culture.I did not like the film for this reason.The DVD contains interviews with director Marco Bellocchio, editor Silvano Agosti, actor Lou Castel, actor Paola Pitagora and film critic Tullio Kezich. The DVD also has a theatrical trailer and an afterward by Bernardo Bertolucci.This film remains controversial and is not for everybody.",negative

This Faustian tale of a man's corruption by wealth, society and his own vanity under the guidance of a devilish temptor while common enough has a unique twist in that the devil himself hates his job of temptation as it divides him from heaven. The reader can delight in the double meanings of the novel, knowing what the hero cannot see in his ""benefactor"".The book is melodramatic, and at times longwinded, and sadly occassionally whiny, but it is strangely absorbing even when it descends into silliness, and the characters can be understood and to some extent sympathized with.

The overall effect is a bad deja vu where the lead never learns a thing.

The dogs don't seem to care one way or the other as they often lie on the bare floor. They do seem to like the rolled part that they can lay their head on. The bed is tidey and washable which beats the cedar filled beds which eventually compact and get thrown out so we will see how they do long term.

It gives off the impression that you can rotate the halves of the boxes and in essence ""play"" with the box, but that is not the case, as the halves only fit together in one way. When put together, the fingers of the box halves have nothing to be supported against at the tip and will flex inward.The movie quality is as others described it, and makes for an enjoyable experience.In all i'm still happy with the purchase, although I'll probably put the discs into a binder and add some weights to the box and glue it shut, to use as a paperweight of sorts.",positive

"Although this book is free, your time is still valuable. Therefore, before deciding to download, you should be aware that this book is aimed at Christians who believe that there are essential differences between men and women, and that men's particular characteristics make them better suited to lead. These assumptions shape the book in ways both obvious and subtle. For example, both husbands and wives are advised to make a date to participate in their spouse's hobby, but the dates are framed differently: husbands should help their wives, while wives should learn from their husbands. If these beliefs reflect your own, go forth and download. If not, well, there are still some potentially useful date ideas and discussion topics, albeit nothing you couldn't come up with on your own.",negative

We tried hanging VERY light things(using mulitple hooks, mind you)without any success for more than a day. After multiple attemps, I said forget it because I knew that something I was attempting to hang was going to end up falling and getting broken with these useless hooks. Furthermore, when they fell off, they took the new paint with it! Not only did they not work, but they were NOT damage free. I ended up using small hanging nails in the end, which was what I was trying to avoid in the first place by buying these. These were a complete waste of time and money, and also damaged my freshly painted walls! NOT HAPPY!",negative

"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",positive

I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...

The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.

They're no longer ""boys"" as their title suggests. There is only one gem on this release, the last track, a piano version of the song ""London"" from the ""Release"" album. But, the rest of the water is sterile, trancey and devoid of any of the character that PSB once displayed. As a long time fan, I'm extremely disappointed. ""Disco 2"" was great, but version three is just a bad sequel. I recommend PSB's album ""Very"" and especially the re-release version with a Disc 2 of remixes.",negative

If there was more time taken to ""accomplish"" all of his tasks then I think I would have enjoyed it more. That being said, A New Dawn was very well-written and Kyle Rayner was a very interesting character to read about. I especially liked Superman's appearance with a mullet (quite humorous, indeed). Because of the cool idea of Emerald Twilight (but poorly executed) and the great execution of A New Dawn, I give it a fairly good rating.",neutral

I somehow don't think this one will disappoint.My picks for the catchiest songs: Take Me Out, Michael, Come On Home, 40'",positive

I finished the book and still had a feeling of disatisfaction. This book was not as strong as it could have been. It either should have been longer or needed better editing.And, there were some sections that were repetitive or the descriptors that were used were nothing short of the sort that made my eyes roll.

I just can't believe the things that happened!!

Yes the app was good.  The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!

But the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!

When we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.

I was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  
I ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!

When we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.

When she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.",negative

I found it too confusing in trying to make the formulas fit with what the text was trying to tell me. In short, I got so lost I had to reread several points, which detracted from the overall experience of learning. It's excrutiatingly detailed, to say the least.

"Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. 

Gils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. 

I had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? 

The whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good. 

The rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back.

I dont even recall what the story involved. Usually with a Dragonlance book I read untill the roof falls on my head. Even then if I didn't die I would keep on reading.

I have met people like Cliff Baxter, but none of them would go to the extremes that Baxter goes to in this novel.This book reminds me of a sophisticated ""First Blood"". Instead of the hero being a rugged John Rambo, the hero is a well dressed, clean shaven Keith Landry who, instead of being a Green Beret War hero, is a top government secret agent who happened to date the Sherrif's wife when he was in high school and college. The action in this book is great, but it seems a little far fetched. I would read this book as entertainment, but wouldn't spend too much time trying look at the realism.",positive

The premise of the book is a family who are living securely in a neighborhood with an idyllic setting, when a house is built beside of them and their secure little world becomes rattled. With this house come a number of inhabitants who all undergo tragedies. At first the neighbor chalks it up to a coincidence but then it happens each and every time a new family moves in and each time it is decidly worse. It was creepy for sure and I agree with the other reviewer who said it was unbelievable, but at the same time most horror/scary things are unbelievable.

"Baker's ""Mezzanine"" came to me highly reccommended by a trusted source, someone with whom I have shared my enjoyment of Delillo and Will Self. I approached Baker's novel optimistically, and was sorely disappointed. Baker's style is indeed unique and his diction is flawless. For this, he is to be commended. What ""The Mezzanine"" lacked, however, is anything transcendent. Though, as other reviewers noted, Baker does describe the minutae of our lives in unique ways, he still describes minutae. Perhaps this novel is a postmodern examination of the emptiness of corporate life--postmodern in own emptiness. If so, a short story would have sufficed. After about forty pages, this novel begins to feel tedious. Eventually, one begins to wonder if anything apart from a neurotic impulse was propelling Baker to lengthen this book.",negative

I thought this movie was a ridiculous attempt at turning a good guy into a bad guy. Denzel Washington isn't very good at pretending to be a bad guy.The movie drags on for 2 hours and has no point what so ever.

Starting with simplevoice leading illustrations using basic jazz voicings all the way tocomplex chord construction using both traditional and modernapproaches, this book covers a lot of ground.

"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night for dinner because we had a restaurant.com gift certificate. Yes, it's in the Sheraton, and yes it's near the airport with not much else around, but I have to say- we were both impressed. 

We started with the Gambas al Fuego, which were deliciously spicy (although I thought that $10 for four shrimp was a bit excessive, no matter how tasty they were). We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.

If it wasn't so out of the way, we would definitely come by regularly. My husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich, so I think we'll be back during lunch in the near future. 

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was that the atmosphere was pretty dead. Which I suppose is understandable, given that it's inside the Sheraton. The decor was nice though. They should have a free standing restaurant in an area with more traffic- this place would be a hit.",positive

Our daughter is 2 1/2 and loves Thomas the Tank Engine books, iPhone apps, and Duplo set. However, she is rather sensitive and it really upset her to see the trains on the DVD crash or get dirty. She doesn't even want to watch the DVD and says ""no"" if we try to play it. We are putting it away and will try again when she is a little older.",positive

"I was fairly surprised to visit Line Thai and find some decently authentic, good-tasting Thai food. I'd always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents' place in Surprise.

Anyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it ""phat si iew"") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.

The hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.

The service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.

My parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.

The atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and it's not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really.

All in all, it was a nice experience at a reasonable price and I'll definitely make a visit next time I hang out with the 'rents.",positive

The struggle and turmoil he dealt with are chronicled ably. His style is to jump back and forth between past events and current feelings, like the omniscient narrator in a movie would; it is an effective way to comment upon occurrences and enlighten the reader. He also has a take-no-prisoners style of writing (notably on what gay life is like) that may be a little disconcerting to some readers. And on occasion I was impatient with all those pre-gay details and wanted to know what happened after he came out, but the book is really the story of what happened to him before he came out. Overall, a poignant and satisfying read.",positive

The new kid Roy and the shoeless truant joins together on a secret mission-saving a family of endangered burrowing owls from being destroyed by the construction of a pancake restaurant on the lot where their home is located. Transplanted Montanian Roy is thrust into a world of capitalistic adults, limelight-loving politicians, school bullies,child abuse, and civil disobedience. Filled with humor, it also touches on the realities of child abuse and destruction of wildlife habitats.

"This is a general book, and is good for those who may have some doubts about their faith in Christ. As a Deist, I felt that deism was linked with atheism too much. Deism is the belief in God based on reason, and atheism isn't. The book covers Paine, Hume, Bolingbroke, Jefferson, Voltaire, among others, but leaves out John Locke.

"I enjoyed this book at least as much and probably more than the first two in the series. This is almost certainly the easiest read so far although I think the material from the first couple of books is important in being able to quickly dive in and understand this one. This book did not seem to suffer from the act three lull that the first couple did. The Deus Ex Machina was slightly better explained but leavong that bit od godly whimsy that appears to be a mainstay of the series.I think this book is the of those I've read in this series, to date.

"I just recently purchased a treadmill for the first time, and it was recommended to me that I wax it every 3 months, not the every 6 months indicated in the manual since I run on it alot.I ordered this wax kit and it received it pretty quickly without any complaints.The instructions were pretty simple to follow, and the actual application of the wax on the ""wand"" and then on the treadmill, in thoery, were fairly simple as well.I only gave the product 3 stars for the following reasons:1. the lube is quite runny and it did drip on things as I maneuvered it onder the treadmill belt.2. the applicator wand is NOT designed for wide treadmill decks (I believe mine is 22"" wide) so it was VERY hard to move the stick up and down the deck because my belt was just slightly wider than the stick. Now only was it difficult to move, the edge of the belt tore my fingers up in the process.In the end, the lube does do it's job, it's just not super easy getting it there if you've got a wide deck.",neutral

"I can't understand how this book is so popular and a ""national bestseller."" I'm hoping it is due to the fact that The Alchemist was such a wonderful book that others (like myself) eagerly await another hit by this writer. However, after having read three other books by Mr. Coelho since The Alchemist, I'm finally throwing in the towel because I just don't think they're anything more than ok. Sure, they have all been centered on larger issues of morality, life, and the tough questions we find ourselves asking (such as whether man inherently good or evil, as this book tries to examine). But they have all, this one most of all, seemed too trite to me, considering the weight of their underlying themes. While I appreciate how Mr. Coelho tries to explore interesting and difficult questions, I found this novel in particular undreadable and didn't care enough to find out what the townspeople did at the end of the book...I simply stopped reading.",negative

It had a reasonably good looking cast, and our local 'fringe' movie house had it playing and was sold out every time! All in all, it sounded better than it ended up being.VIDEO QUALITY:Who ever mastered this blu-ray did an excellent job, it's gorgeous, and the sound's pretty good too!!YOU SHOULD BUY IT IF:You like rock operas, while it wasn't what we expected, and it's nothing that I'd suggest anyone ran out and bought, for the price, if you like this kind of movie, it's probably a good buy for you. The other reviews all sing its' praises. I feel that if you're not into it, you won't change your mind :)",negative

The main character, Janie, was a good character to revolve the story around. Overall the book was intriguing, especially toward the end when something unexpected happens between Janie and her husband Tea Cake. There is also a lot of good symbolism used.

For in the final analysis, we are all here to learn life's lessons, face them squarely, and move on to better things - in this life or the next.Like the Don Juan novels of Carlos Castenada, a series of logically impossible phenomena and events are recounted that take place on the edge of our knowledges.

"'Shamanism and Personal Mastery' promises great changes, but then leaves all the work to you. The description of shamanic tools, such as conscious projection, power words, and power objects, is too superficial to be practically useful. The author spends far more time suggesting how your mental and emotional attitudes will affect your results. The suggestion is that changing your thinking is the key to personal mastery, and shamanic tools are simply methods which help you focus. However, the suggestions for positive and purposeful thinking are just as vaugue as the descritptions of shamanic tools. You'd be better off getting books that are pure psychology, or pure shamanism. This book attempts to be both, and succeeds at neither.",negative

"Went back to AB a few weekends ago, again for brunch, with a large group.  I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.",positive

That can't be good for the finnish.I also don't like where the graple fixture is located for bolting the light to in relation to the clamp's thumb-screw knob. Kind of gets in the way of the light's yoke, especially split yokes.",positive

Although the author in the past has accused liberals of pretty much everything, in her new book Ann reaches out to the liberal cause and encourages conservatives to initiate dialogue with the έΑεother sideέΑζ. After reading through the book it would seem that Coulter has had a change of heart, and while one could hardly expect her to take up the liberal torch she does get the point across that the only way to build a better country is through conservatives and liberals communicating with each other. The book is full of helpful tips on how conservatives can initiate this process and plenty of examples on how the two sides can compromise on a whole array of issues. Perhaps a different side to Coulter that might put off a lot of her loyal followers but still a very good read.",negative

Jerry constantly reminds the reader that he was a Jew and constantly seems on the defense, it makes for an uneasy read. I will admit Jerry does dish out the trash we've come to expect from him, like the story about the man who ""loves"" his horse.

This work is a good read, having much similarity with the other Haggard African novels. There are lots of adventures and several dark villains as well, and the character development brings out that of Galazi, the Wolf, and Mopo, who assumed the role of Umslopogass's father.

"My husband and I don't share the same taste. I LOVED this table he didn't. I still LOVE it, but I had to put this together myself after talking him into buying it. I am a handy DIY girl who knows her way around power tools and such. Seems like 8 bolts shouldn't be that hard, but I had to chisle and sand part of one corner off the bottom table because it overlapped so the leg wouldn't slide through. One of the bolt holes in the leg came with a wooden dowel lodged in it that I had to remove by breaking it out with a small screwdriver. And one of the bolts does not line up with the holes no matter how I try to manover the piece. This is going to make my husband dislike this piece even more. I will try to bring the leg back and replace it with another leg. I didn't want to bring back the whole table becase it would be an excuse for him to make me leave it there. I do LOVE this table. I did splurge on this table instead of upcycling and making my own like I do for a lot of things, and seems to me that if I am going to pay for something it should at least go together right without me having to take multiple trips to get replacement parts, but I find this the case with most things you purchase these days which is a bit sad. Was I surprised, no, but when you talk your husband into buying something he doesn't care for, you would rather have it go smoothly.

The media hides behind the first amendment to try to run the country on their terms by using media bias to sway public opinion on subjects from who gets elected president to which laws get passed. The only problem, there is no way to end such bias.",positive

"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the ""evil"" influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, ""there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written."" Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes.",positive

"So the first 4 chapters of this book are a work of art. They perfect the technique of using spin as an introduction to quantum concepts that Feynman made so famous in his Caltech lectures (yes, that's right, Sakurai did it better). So for understanding the core ideas of quantum the text and exercises (I worked almost all of them) of chapters 1-4 are great.Unfortunately, Sakurai died part way thru this project and it's pretty evident that chapters 5-7 (perturbation, permutations, & scattering) are someone else's doing. They don't really provide any great insight and are poorly organized. At this point; you're probably better off going back to Messiah or Merzbacher. There's also no treatment of relativistic quantum mechanics. An unfortunate end to what starts as a truely great book.",positive

I think sizing is very important when shopping online. I know that size of different manufacturers may vary a little bit, not everyone makes exactly same, but 2+ unit difference seems too much.And I can't return it because I shop from outside of USA and shipping back is too much hassle.so as an advice I suggest to buy +3w from what you actually wear and maybe +2 of length.",neutral

"While some in my book group found this book difficult to get into, others were intrigued by the similarity of themes to contemporary times. Are we not concerned about those with rigid beliefs that defy understanding and who reject any attempt to reason? That would be the characters of Gradgrind and Bounderby. Do we not sympathize with workers subjected to inhumane conditions, miners, factory workers, particularly in foreign countries? That would be the workers in Coketown, Dickens' fictional setting for this novel. Labor vs. management, education as facts forced into children, love thwarted, parents who misunderstand children, people who spy on others, people stuck in their unfortunate circumstances, bad marriages, these are all interesting themes explored in this book, one of Dickens shorter novels. Give it a chance beyond the first 20 pages.",positive
